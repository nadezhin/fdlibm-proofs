ACL2 proofs about Fdlibm in C and Java
- translit-fdlibm  A program that transliterate Fdlibm C files into FdlibmTranslitN.java ;
- llvm2acl2   Converts .llvm compiles from Fdllibm C files by clang into ACL2 files.
              Also some proofs of equivalence between .llvm translation and FdlibmTranslit.java are here.
- cohen-djvm  ACL2 files of Richard Cohen's Defensive JVM obtained from
